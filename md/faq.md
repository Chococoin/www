# FAQ

### When is the Token Sale?

We are working with the community to design the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that will control the funds generated in the Token Sale. We want to get every detail right as this DAO is likely to control millions of ether. Join our Slack to help us build the DAO. We will make all of our important announcements to our community on Slack first. 
 
### What problem are you trying to solve?

Large corporations like Uber and Airbnb are setting the standard for the sharing economy. They are empowering thousands of entrepreneurs and have made great strides in the right direction, but from another perspective they are mult-billion dollar corporate middle-men monopolizing the user’s data and taking a hefty chunk of profit for themselves. Using the revolutionary Ethereum Protocol, we are replacing these corporations with versatile smart contracts and a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) that will make these companies unnecessary and obsolete. Slock.it’s mission is to decentralize the sharing economy! To enable P2P trustless interactions with the only middle-man being the Blockchain. Slock.it is enabling people to safely and securely share everything from lawnmowers to apartments directly with each other. If it can be locked it can be Slocked! 

### How does a Slock work? 

Slocks will come in many shapes and sizes depending on the what the owner of Slock wants to use it for, but in general, each Slock will be connected to the Ethereum blockchain and controlled by a Slock.it smart contract. The owner of a Slock can set a deposit amount and a price for using his item, and the user will pay that deposit through a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain, thereby getting permission to open and close that Slock through their smart phone. The deposit will be locked in the Ethereum blockchain until the user is done with the item and a closing transaction is sent to the Ethereum blockchain. Then the contract will be automatically enforced. The deposit will be sent back to the user minus the price for the rental which will be automatically sent to the owner of the Slock. All of this happens without any assistance from a third-party!

How exactly Slock Smart contracts will be coded is still being determined See our Github and join the Slack to help us build this revolutionary infrastructure.

### How will you keep someone from stealing or breaking my Slocked item?

If you believe your item has a high probability of being damaged, then you can put a large deposit on the Slock. Classic protections such as third party insurence or video survelence can be implemented, but as the ecosystem grows, we many creative solutions will evolve. We can have create different Slock.it smart contracts with extra requirements, some may require user issued tokens, or identity verification. Eventually a reputation system will be built on Ethereum and this can be integrated if the Slock owner desires.  

Our technology will have many use cases,beyond the sharing economy; while decentralizing the sharing economy is Slock.it’s long term goal, we recognize that sharing lawnmowers may not be the first use case. Slock.it technology out of the box will allow anyone to make a vending machine for anything using a “Slocker”; it will allow people to share anything that can be plugged into a wall like a laundry machine or a blender; it can help you sell anything that can be measured and dispensed by the user themselves like beer, filtered water, soft serve ice cream, or even electricity (Our hackathon was won by the autonomous solar charger Solether [link]). Everyone we talk with has a different use case for this technology, and as it is developed many things that may not be feasible to use Slocks for now will find free market solutions.

### When are you going to have a working Slock that can be used?


We have prototypes that work now, but we are hesitant to release this technology into the world until further testing and development has been done. Everything we do is open source and will  use generic componants, so that people will be able to build the Slocks at home as we develop them if they desire. The exact timeline is still to be decided as there are a lot of details to be worked out! We are focusing on building the world’s first Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that will control the funds raised in our crowdsale as the DAO will need to be constructed before Slocks can enter the marketplace.

### Are you creating your own currency to use on the Slocks?

Ether is the main digital currency used to in Slock.it smart contracts. We are creating a token to fuel our DAO and that too will be accepted by Slocks at a small discount to ether. These tokens will be given to the supporters of the crowdsale and will be tradable in the open market. It is not a currency but a Digital Asset: it allows the holder to participate in the development of the DAO, vote on important issues, and gives them access to a portion of the revenue generated by Slocks. 

### What will the DAO do exactly?

We are still in the process of developing the code for the DAO, so nothing is set in stone, and if you have a desire to be part of this process, please join the conversation in our Slack and on Github (Links). So far we believe the DAO will vote on:

1. How to spend the funds raised in the token sale. The DAO will control all the funds generated in the crowd sale and can hire or fire any business partner, including Slock.it Labs.
2. What percentage of revenue generated by the Slocks goes to the Slock Token holders. 1% of each successful Slock transaction is the default percentage to be split amongst all Slock Token Holders. This percentage can be adjusted up or down to work with market forces and this is revenue that goes directly to the Slock Token Holders, NOT THE DAO.
3. When to sell more Slock Tokens and what price to value them. If the DAO wants to raise funds, the only revenue stream it has is to sell more tokens. 
4. How much ether will be paid to buy out the Slock of the revenue stream going to the the Slock Token holders. Each Slock will be programmed to generate a revenue stream of about 1% to the Slock Token Holders forever, unless the owner of the Slock agrees to buy out this smart contract by paying a one time fee that can be adjusted by the DAO and will be set at a default of 1000 ether..


### Who is Slock.it’s potential market?

Entrepreneurs that want to effortlessly share items that sit in their garage collecting dust, and anyone that doesn’t want to buy and store an item that they will rarely use. Just like how anyone who wants a place to sleep can search on Airbnb, anyone anywhere in the world who wants to rent anything (including a place to sleep) will be able to utilize the Slock network.
