By Slock.it, Ethereum.org, Devcon One

November 3rd, 2015, **London, England** – Could the existing ‘sharing economy’ companies soon become irrelevant? That’s what the German startup <a href="http://slock.it">Slock.it</a> hopes to demonstrate next week when it unveils a technology promising to empower anyone to easily rent, share or sell anything that can be locked. 

Christoph Jentzsch, Founder, said “We chose Devcon to reveal <a href="http://slock.it">Slock.it</a> simply because it’s by far the most prestigious and cutting edge blockchain conference this year. We couldn't think of a better platform to launch.” 

Using digital smart contracts, Slock.it could decentralize the sharing economy just like Bitcoin decentralized currency. It would not be the first time that blockchain crossed path with the Internet of Things, as IBM and Samsung recently explored the potential of leveraging the technology to help address the IoT’s monetization, privacy, and security challenges.

No doubt industry CTOs will be interested in learning more about Slock.it’s technology stack, as it can be embedded in almost any device, bringing the benefits of the blockchain - transparency, security and auditablity - to real-word objects.
