<a href="images/stephantual.jpg" class="swipebox"><img src="images/stephantual.jpg" style="width:30%;padding-left:10px" align="right" alt="the slock.it concept"/></a> Slock.it’s third and final Founder has been revealed as former Ethereum’s CCO’s Stephan Tual. Mr Tual, an IT veteran of 20 years, bring extensive enterprise experience to the Slock.it project. Before focusing on blockchain technology, Stephan held CxO positions at two leading Big Data analytics companies in London, working for clients including BP, Visa, The Co-op and Boots. 

Christoph Jentzsch, Founder, said ”Stephan’s expertise will be critical when negotiating with our present and future integration partners. He was part of the Ethereum project since day one, has an excellent standing within the community, and his dutiful approach to relationship building is something we look forward to see flourish within Slock.it.”

Speaking from the Devcon One blockchain conference in London, Tual said, “Slock.it addresses the number one feature gap with smart contracts: making them enforceable. And it does that without futuristic mumbo-jumbo but instead by offering a series of no-nonsense hardware integrations that can introduce cost savings today. I feel we’ve just begun to scratch the surface of what the blockchain can offer in this domain, and I’m thrilled to explore this space with Slock.it.”
